# Overview

I love learning new languages and frameworks So this is my first attempt at Erlang. Erlang is a very nice language and makes it easy to write robust code. The purpose of this project was twofold: first, to gain hands-on experience with Erlang and its unique programming model; and second, to create a practical application that showcases the language's strengths in building scalable, real-time systems.

# Development Environment

The software was written entirely in Erlang, using the standard libraries and OTP framework. Specifically, the gen_server behavior was used to implement the chat server process, while the lists module was used for manipulating lists of connected clients.

# Future Work
